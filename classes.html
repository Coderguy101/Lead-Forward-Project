        <img src="images/cs.png">
        <p> In your Intro to Computer Science Sequence, you will be introduced to fundamental programming techniques essential to any programming language. 
          These could include things like loops, boolean logic, object-oriented programing, etc. You will also be introduced to more advanced topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, and pointers. 
          You will learn things quick in your intro sequence, and it is crucial you do not fall behind.

        <img src="images/algs.png">
        <p> This class is usually taken after your Intro to Computer Science Sequence. In this course, you will learn about data structures and algorithms that 
          combine many of the concepts and techniques you have learned. You will have far more complicated programming assignments in this course, so make sure 
          to start them early. Try to understand the different data structures and how they work (Stacks, Maps, Trees, Etc) very well because topics from  
          this course will likely be tested during your technical interviews.

    <p class="user-detials"><b>Intro to Computer Organization</b><br></p>
    <img src="images/org.png">
    <p> This course introduces you to the underlying logic of how computers function. You will be introduced to more advanced boolean logic in this class, and 
      you will also learn some basic assembly language commands. Additionally, you will do an extensive C review, intensively studying pointers.

    <img src="images/se.jpg">
    <p> This course introduces you to what it means to be a Software Developer rather than simply a programmer. 
      You will intensively study some very fundamental design principles on what it means to be a good programmer, such as coding to the interface, 
      Separation of Concerns, Design by Contract, etc. You will walk away from this course with much better coding practices. This course is a lot of work, and 
      make sure to start your projects in this class early.

    <img src="images/linear.png">
    <p> Linear Algebra is the mathematical study of vectors and matrices. Linear algebra is the most helpful 
      field of mathematics in Computer Science, as it is used in many different fields. You will learn valuable concepts,
      such as linear transformations, vector spaces, eigenvectors, and much more, and go over examples on how linear algebra 
      can be applied to other fields, such as computing.

<p> Intro To Operating Systems is regarded as one of the most challenging classes in the entire CS major. In this course, you will intensively study
  Operating Systems to develop and understand how exactly the hardware and software interact. Make sure to have a good
  professor for this course, as it is one of the most important classes you will take.

    <p class="class-description text-center offset-2">While the question of whether or not you should study Computer Science is going to ultimately
      be a decision you must make, here are some key skills you will need as a Computer Scientist to help you make an informed decision.

        <img src="images/ProblemSolving.png">
        <p> If you've always been the type of person who naturally was drawn to math and science, then Computer Science may be for you. Computer Science is all about problem-solving, and you will have to be able to work through large-scale projects in your career diligently. Nobody writes perfect code on their first try, and having a solid ability to 
          logically trace back and understand every aspect of your code will be critical for you to know.

        <img src="images/change.png">
        <p> 
          It is no secret that the tech industry is one of the fastest-changing industries to go into. Change is inevitable in Computer Science; it's not
          about if change will happen; it is about when change will happen and, more importantly, how you will respond to change. Throughout your coursework at
          Clemson, you will be expected to quickly pick up new languages with little instruction (C++, Java, C, python, etc) and quickly apply often abstract
          concepts to numerous coding assignments.

    <p class="user-detials"><b>A Passion to Understand How Computer's function at their core</b><br></p>
    <img src="images/passion.png">
    <p>While being interested in the field may seem obvious, you would be surprised at how many people go into Computer Science specifically because they think it will be relatively easy and pay well. This is false, Computer Science is a complex field and while it does pay well, if you are not at least somewhat interested in your work, you will not get far. 
      Computer Science is currently the major with the highest dropout rate; it is crucial you have some underlying passion for Computing.
